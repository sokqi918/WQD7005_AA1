## Case Study: E-Commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis 
## Background: 
You will work with a dataset of customer transactions from an e-commerce website, encompassing various customer attributes and purchase history over the last year. The structure provided below is a guideline. Feel free to enhance this dataset by adding  relevant attributes that you believe will enrich your analysis. Use the structure as a 
foundation to create your own sample dataset that reflects realistic customer behaviour. 

## Dataset Structure: 

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer. 

Age: Age of the customer. 

Gender: Gender of the customer. 

Location: Geographic location of the customer. 

MembershipLevel: Indicates the membership level (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum). 

TotalPurchases: Total number of purchases made by the customer. 

TotalSpent: Total amount spent by the customer. 

FavoriteCategory: The category in which the customer most frequently shops (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Home Goods). 

LastPurchaseDate: The date of the last purchase. 

[Additional Attributes]: Consider adding more attributes like customer's occupation, frequency of website visits, etc. 

Churn: Indicates whether the customer has stopped purchasing (1 for churned, 0 for active).

## Objective: 
The case study aims to apply decision tree and ensemble methods in a practical context, demonstrating their understanding of the concepts and their ability to derive meaningful business insights from data analysis.
