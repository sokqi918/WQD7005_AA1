## Reflection or Learning Outcomes

In this section, I will explain the rationale and challenges I faced in this case study.

### Rationale and Challenges

In this report, I used three tools including Talend Data Integration, Talend Data Preparation and SAS Enterprise Miner to complete this alternative assessment.

For Talend Data Integration, the rationale to choose this tool for its robust data integration capabilities, allowing seamless extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. It enables the integration of diverse data sources, in this case, it was used to integrate two datasets for subsequent analysis. Potential challenges include handling large datasets and ensuring data quality throughout the integration process. Hence, to ensure data quality, Talend Data Preparation comes to the place.

For Talend Data Preparation, it is used for exploring the missing value and data inconsistencies, transforming data and cleaning data directly. It offers user-friendly features for cleaning, enriching, and aggregating data, facilitating a more meaningful analysis and produce data quality. One of the challenges in Talend Data Preparation is handling with various columns. As my dataset consists of 23 columns after integration, it will be consumed more time to explore the data patterns one by one.
 
For SAS Enterprise Miner, it is a powerful tool for predictive modelling and analysis. It is able to construct decision trees and ensembled methods, providing valuable insights into customer behaviours. 

### Insight of Decision Trre and Ensemble Method Analysis

In our analysis, we looked at different types of decision trees to understand how certain factors relate to customer behaviour. Decision Tree at maximal levels showed good performance and gave us valuable insights into the complex decisions customers make. We suggest focusing on this detailed tree because it helps us understand customer behaviour in a clear and meaningful way. When we used advanced methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, they performed better than individual decision trees. Random Forest, in particular, was the best at making accurate predictions.

### Business Strategy

For business strategies, we suggest using what we've learned to improve how we engage with customers. Creating personalized marketing campaigns based on important factors like **Tenure, Number of Addresses, Complaints, Satisfaction Score, and Cashback Amount** can be effective. It's also important to keep an eye on trends in customer behaviour and adjust our strategies accordingly. In conclusion, the tools we used, Talend Data Integration, Talend Data Preparation, and SAS Enterprise Miner, helped us understand customer behaviour and provided practical insights for better business strategies.
